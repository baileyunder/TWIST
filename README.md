# TWIST Web Project

This repository is for the TWIST project. The goal of this project is to make a website for the Teen Women in Science and Technology event that allows users to register for the event as well as for administrators to access the database for sessions to add to it or make changes.  

The website has 3 main parts:  

- Homepage with information
- Registration page
- Admin page

## Design

For the design of the website we chose to use the K-State color theme in order to associate the event with the college. We also used a fun logo for the banner that is used on all of the pages which was created by Drew. There is navagation on each page to route the user to either the homepage or the admin login page and ways to go back to the previous page.  

## Challenges

The main challenge for this project was the collaboration. I think only a few people knew how to use Git and GitHub let alone how to clone repositories and work on them in a local environment. There were also very few meetings for the teams to meet virtually. This led to the website only being about half-completed. I tried my best to send out communications across different platforms regarding what needed to be completed.

Another challenge, and one that we did overcome, was hosting the web app on Heroku. It took a little bit, but we were able to solve the issues we were encountering and were able to get the site working really well on the platform. It takes a bit to load if the site has not been visited in a while however.

## New Things Used and Learned

The front end team used Visual Studio Code and we found a great plugin from Microsoft called Live Share that allowed us to collaborate on the same files and see what everyone else was working on. Granted we only used it for one coding session, but it was enough to get the majority of the website styled. Also learning Express opens up a whole new realm of possibilities when it comes to making websites. I have learned how to use template engines to render HTML and how to route users to different pages using Express and JavaScript. I spent most of my time with the Pug template engine and setting up the environment. I also learned about some neat Node modules you can use with express for static websites while I was researching. It will definitely come in handy for personal projects.
